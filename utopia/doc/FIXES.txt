API reduction:
Fix parameters with undefined default values to avoid overwritting the existing ones memory mangement of petsc tensors sucks (shared_ptr not consitently used)



// Line 18 doesnt work 
{
    Vector v = zeros(2);
    {
        Write<Vector> w(v);
        v.set(0, 1.0);
        v.set(1, 10.0);
    }

    double one = norm2(v) * norm2(v) / dot(v, v);
    assert(approxeq(1.0, one));

    one = norm2(v/norm2(v));
    std::cout << "done\n";
    assert(approxeq(1.0, one));
}


Non-linear solvers:
REFACTOR: Add line-search to newton solver, remove LineSearchBase and name LineSearchStrategy as LineSearch.
FIX: call update on function if the solution changes and we need to recompute either value, gradient or hessian. 

Constrained solvers:
REFACTOR: decouple box-constraints from function

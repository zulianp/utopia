1) API reduction:
Fix parameters with undefined default values to avoid overwritting the existing ones memory mangement of petsc tensors sucks (shared_ptr not consitently used)

2) The classes using Parameters need to be better designed. There are diamond-like hierarchies which is really bad.

// Line 18 doesnt work 
{
    Vector v = zeros(2);
    {
        Write<Vector> w(v);
        v.set(0, 1.0);
        v.set(1, 10.0);
    }

    double one = norm2(v) * norm2(v) / dot(v, v);
    assert(approxeq(1.0, one));

    one = norm2(v/norm2(v));
    std::cout << "done\n";
    assert(approxeq(1.0, one));
}
